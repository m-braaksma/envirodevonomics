## Motivation

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- Air pollution is a significant issue many parts of the world
- Studies have estimated the health effects of pollution in developed countries
- Reason to believe this evidence may not be externally valid for developing countries

### Research Question 
> What is the effect of pollution on infant mortality in the context of a developing country?
:::

::::


## Overview 

- Context: Mexico 1997 – 2006
    - Rapidly industrializing during this time period
    - Also implemented policies aimed at improving air quality
- Methods: fixed effects and IV using thermal inversions
- Findings: 
    - Evidence that pollution increases infant mortality
    - Compared to the US, larger marginal effects for CO and similar marginal effects for PM~10~
- Concern: other factors may be correlated with health
    - weather, socio-economic status and changes in economic conditions

## Data
### Mexico City 1997 – 2006
### 

1. Neonatal and infant mortality
    - 

2. Pollution
    - 

3. Thermal inversions
    - 

4. Temperature and weather
    - 


## Empirical Strategy 
### Fixed Effects

Objective: estimate $\beta_1$ the relationship between pollution ($P_{mw}$) in a municipality ($m$) in a given week ($w$) and mortality per 100,000 live births ($Y_{mw}$)
$$
Y_{mw} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 P_{mw} + \alpha_m + \sigma_{mj} + \epsilon_{mw}
$$

- $\alpha_m$ is a set of municipality fixed effects that control for permanent differences across municipalities
- $\sigma_{mj}$ is a set of bimonthly x municipality fixed effects, which control for common factors in a given two month block that could affect both pollution levels and infant mortality within a municipality

## Empirical Strategy 
### Fixed Effects

$$
Y_{mw} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 P_{mw} + \alpha_m + \sigma_{mj} + \epsilon_{mw}
$$

Concerns:

- Unobserved, *time-varying* differences across municipalities will bias $\beta_1$
- Classical measurement error in the pollution variable will bias $\beta_1$ downwards

## Empirical Strategy
### Instrumental Variables

Objective: test whether inversions increase the concentrations of
different types of pollutants $\rightarrow$ use the number of thermal inversions in a given week ($TI_w$) to instrument for pollution

$$
\begin{align*}
P_{mw} &= \pi_0 + \pi_1 TI_w + \sum \pi_{2m} w + h(W_{mw}) + \alpha_m + \sigma_{mj} + \mu_{mw} \\
Y_{mw} &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 P_{mw} + \sum \beta_{2m} w + h(W_{mw}) + \alpha_m + \sigma_{mj} + \epsilon_{mw}
\end{align*}
$$

- $TI_w$ varies at the week level so week by year fixed effects are not identified
    - control for municipality-specific week by year trends ($w$)
- municipality fixed effects ($\alpha_m$) control for *time-invariant* characteristics across municipalities
- bimonthly x municipality fixed effects ($\sigma_{mj}$) control for seasonal effects within each municipality
- $h(W_{mw})$ is a set of controls for temperature and weather conditions

## Empirical Strategy
### Instrumental Variables

$$
\begin{align*}
P_{mw} &= \pi_0 + \pi_1 TI_w + \sum \pi_{2m} w + h(W_{mw}) + \alpha_m + \sigma_{mj} + \mu_{mw} \\
Y_{mw} &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 P_{mw} + \sum \beta_{2m} w + h(W_{mw}) + \alpha_m + \sigma_{mj} + \epsilon_{mw}
\end{align*}
$$

Concerns:
- Exclusion restriction 
- residual seasonal variation
- Another concern is that models that estimate the effect of pollution on infant death within a short time frame, such as week, overstate the effect.
