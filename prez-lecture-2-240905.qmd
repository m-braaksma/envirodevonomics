## Motivation

- Poverty eradication and global warming are enormous challenges facing the global community 
    - Issues are inter-linked

- Climate change is known to hinder poverty eradication efforts
    - But how does poverty eradication impact the environment?


## Poverty alleviation and local environmental degradation: An empirical analysis in Colombia

### Daniele Malerba

- Explores the causal link between poverty reduction at the household level and environmental impact at the local (municipal) level

- Cash transfer program in Colombia increases consumption at the household level

- Unexpectedly, this does not increase deforestation in the municipality



<!-- ## Lit Review (optional) -->

## Background

- *Familias en Acción* (FA) in Colombia
    - conditional cash transfer program

- Eligibility determined in a two step process
    1. Target municipalities^[Criteria: provision of appropriate documentation, the presence of at least one bank, the presence of facilities able to provide access to basic education and healthcare, and a population size of <100,000 inhabitants]
    2. Target households^[Criteria: poorest 20% of families with children between 0 and 17 years of age, and required to register and to comply with the conditions of the program]
        - Included health, nutrition and education stipulations to remain eligible

### Household data

- FA program evaluation
    - Three waves: 2002, 2003 and 2005/6

### Municipal Data

- Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and Environmental Studies 30m Forest Cover
    - 2000, 2005
- Open-Data Inventory for Anthropogenic CO~2~ 1km monthly emissions
    - 2000, 2005

## Empirical Strategy

### Household effects

$$
\delta Y_i = \alpha + \delta * T_i + X_i + \epsilon_i
$$

::: {style="font-size: 60%;"}

where $\delta Y_i$ represents the difference in outcome between the two periods, and $X_i$ are baseline variables used for regression adjustment. The coefficient d represents the DID estimate.

:::

- Outcome variable: number of weekly days of beef/milk consumption, refrigerator ownership
- Uses inverse probability treatment weighting and sampling weights

### Municipal effects

$$
y_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 *Treat_i + \beta_2 * Post_t + \beta_3 * (Treat_i * Post_t) + \beta_4 X_{it} + \epsilon_{it}
$$

::: {style="font-size: 60%;"}

where $y_{it}$ is the outcome of interest, such as deforestation in municipality $i$ in year $t$; $Treat_i$ is equal to 1 if the municipality enrolled by 2004 and 0 otherwise; $Post_t$ is equal to 1 for the period after treatment (in this case 2005), and zero for 2000.

## Results
### Household Level

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
- FA has a positive and significant effect:
    - Beef consumption
    - Milk consumption
    - Refrigerator ownership
- Interaction effect with market distance is negative and significant:
    - Refrigerator ownership
:::

## Results
### Municipal Level

![](assets/prez-lecture-2-240905/table6.png)

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
- Municipalities enrolled in FA:
    - Less deforestation
    - Statistically insignificant when reforestation is included

## Summary

- CCT increases the consumption of land-intensive goods and the ownership of energy-intensive assets at the household level
    - Proximity to market matters
- Participating municipalities experienced less deforestation
    - But no difference in emissions

- Policy Implications
    - Environmental impacts of poverty alleviation may be smaller than expected
    - Relationship between poverty alleviation and energy consumption is complex
    - Contextual and local factors matter


<!-- Best Practices:
- 1 minute per slide
- Avoid chart junk
- One line bullets
- No need for full sentences
- Vary text slides and text + image slides
- Don’t put too many equations
- Save details for speaking, or talk “about’ ’ equation
- Summarize findings again at the end -->
