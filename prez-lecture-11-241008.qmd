## Motivation

<!-- Article: https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.20221215 -->

- Popular tool to reduce pollution: reporting pollution violations
- When firms violate pollution standards, they may face private or public appeals (compliants)
- Public appeals are more visible to the public and the media


## Research Question 

> How do firms react to public vs. private scrutny when violating pollution standards?

## Overview 

- Context: China
    - 24,620 firms
- Methods: 
    - RCT of firm assignment to private or public appeals by volunteers monitoring pollution
- Findings:
    - Social media drives public appeals that reduces emissions and violations
    - Public appeals push regulators away from economic growth
    - Reduced emissions by treated firms not offset by emissions from control firms


## Data
### Continuous Emissions Mointoring System (CEMS)

- Hourly emissions data
- 24,620 major polluting plants nationally (75% of total emissions)
- Regulators recieve: 
    - Private Appeals: non-observable complaints
    - Public Appeals: observable complaints via social media (Weibo)


## Data
### China 2020

1. Firms
    - 24,620 polluting plants
    - Daily list of verified violations
        - 5,478 polluters
    - Volunteers filing either private or public appeals
        - 12,596 polluting violation appeals
2. Government Response
    - Track local response by officials
    - Weibo messages & replies, 12,369 phone calls, 12,369 website replies 

## Empirical Strategy
### Experimental Design

## Empirical Strategy
### Clustered RCT

- $T$: Treatment arm $j$

$$
Y_{ijt} = \sum_{j} \alpha_j T_{ij} \times Post_t + \gamma_i + \eta_t + \varepsilon_{ijt}
$$


## Results 
### Pollution Concentration

## Results 
### Violation Over Time

## Results 
### Visibility of Appeal

## Results 
### General Equilibrium

## Summary 

- Publicly visibly violations are far more likely to be sanctioned by regulators
- High polluting firms are unaffected by public appeals and subsequent sanctions
- 'War on Pollution' can be effectively won through bottom-up pressure on low and middle intensity polluters
