## Motivation

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- Deforestation generates a range of negative externalities
- Limited evidence on the role of sanctions in preventing deforestation
    - These sanctions may have spatial spillover effects

### Research Question 
> How do environmental sanctions and spillovers effect forest conservation in the Brazilian Amazon?
:::

::::


## Overview 
- Context: Brazilian Amazon 2000-2019
    - Farms account for 53% of the Amazon’s deforestation
    - In the mid-2000s, the government implemented policies to reduce deforestation rates
- Methods:
    - Staggered difference-in-differences
- Findings:
    - Punished farmers decrease deforestation by 49%
    - Adjacent neighbors decrease by 21%

## Data
### Brazil 2000-2019

1. Farm-year panel data
    - Spatial data and tenure

2. Deforestation and Reforestation
    - Annual LULC 30mx30m, Mapbiomas
    - CO~2~ emissions from  aboveground biomass data, Global ForestWatch

3. Farm-year deforestation-related sanctions
    - Public administrative records, including fines, embargoes, and seizures


## Empirical Strategy
### Staggered DiD

For a given treatment type, an unconditional estimator for the average treatment effect of environmental sanctions for cohort $g$ at year $t \geq g$:

$$
\widehat{ATT}^{type}(g, t) = \frac{\sum_{i} \Delta Y_{ig-1,t} 1\{G_{i}^{type} = g\}}{\sum_{i} 1 \{G_{i}^{type} = g\}} - \frac{\sum_{i} \Delta Y_{ig-1,t} C_{i}}{\sum_{i} C_{i}}
$$

where 

- $i \in {1, 2, ..., N}$ represents farms
- $t \in \{ 2000, 2001, ..., 2019 \}$ years
- $G_{i}^{type} = g \in \{2005, 2006, ..., 2019\}$ treatment cohorts of each type
- $C_{i} = 1$ the control group of never-treated farms
-  $\Delta Y_{ig-1,t} = Y_{i,t} - Y_{i,g-1}$ the evolution of outcome $Y$ in a given year $t$ relative to the year before treatment $g - 1$
:::

## Empirical Strategy
### Staggered DiD

$$
\widehat{ATT}^{type}(g, t) = \frac{\sum_{i} \Delta Y_{ig-1,t} 1\{G_{i}^{type} = g\}}{\sum_{i} 1 \{G_{i}^{type} = g\}} - \frac{\sum_{i} \Delta Y_{ig-1,t} C_{i}}{\sum_{i} C_{i}}
$$

- Equivalent to a two-period/two-group difference-in-differences estimator
    - Compares the average outcome evolution of the treated group in year $t$, post-treatment, relative to year $g - 1$, pre-treatment, with the average outcome evolution of the control group across the same periods
- Main results aggregated to show event studies
    - 5 years of pre- and post-treatment

## Summary 

- Sanctions generate persistent reductions in deforestation
    - Avoiding the emission of 1.599 billion tons of CO~2~
    - Despite relatively low rates of punishment
- Spillovers reduce deforestation among neighboring farmers
- No evidence of strategic displacement to farms further away from punishment
