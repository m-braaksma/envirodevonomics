## Motivation

<!-- Paper: https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/705374?mobileUi=0& -->

- Clean water treatment is very beneficial yet there is low take-up (Ahuja et al., 2010)
- In general, underinvestment in beneficial technologies $\to$ low WTP (Foster and Rosenzweig, 2010; Jack 2011; Dupas and Miguel, 2017)

## Research Question 

> What is the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for clean water technology in Ghana?

> What is the impact of clean water technology on childhood diarrhea?


## Overview 

- Context: Northern Ghana
    - 1,265 households
    - Field experiment to produce water filtration (Kosim filter)
- Methods: 
    - IV for purchasing through BDM auction
    - Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) mechanism to measure WTP
- Findings: 
    - WTP is low relative to cost
    - Demand is inelastic at low prices for clean water technology (take up is low)
    - Diarrhea incidence reduce by 1/3rd but negative effect after 1 year

## Data
### Kosim Water Filter

## Data
### BDM Design

1. Demonstrate the Kosim filter
2. Household has only 1 opportunity to buy
3. Household bids their price (WTP) to purchase
4. Enumerator draws random price from 0 - 100 pesewas
5. If the price is at or below WTP, household must buy the filter

- 272 respondents drew a price $\le WTP$ 
- 269 respondents purchased
- Compared to a take-it-or-leave-it auction (TIOLI)



## Data
### Rural Northern Ghana 

1. Household Surveys
    - 15 villages
    - Follow-up: 1 month, 1 year
    - 1,265 households
    - Childhood rates of diarrhea


## Empirical Strategy
### Instrumental Variable

- $P$: BDM draw (price) instrument
- $T$: Treatment for purchasing filter

$$
\begin{align}
T_{ic} = & \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 P_{ic} + \nu_{ic} \\
y_{ijc} = & \beta_0 + \beta_1 T_{ic} + \varepsilon_{jic}
\end{align}
$$


## Results 
### Treatment Effects

## Results 
### Price Elasticity for WTP

## Results 
### WTP Avoid Statistical Death

## Summary 

- Demand for health goods are low
- Shows the disipating long-run impact of water filtration on childhood diarrhea
- Implied WTP to avoid one statistical child death is only USD 3,604
- BDM auction and TIOLI auction produce similar results (validates BDM)
