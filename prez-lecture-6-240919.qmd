## Motivation

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- Air quality is poor in developing countries and has negative health and economic consequences
- However, poor air quality may actually be optimal if WTP is low
- Limited empirical evidence of WTP for clean air

### Research Question 
> What is the willingness to pay for clean air?
:::

::::


## Overview 

- Context: China 2006-2014
    - Developing country with poor air quality
- Methods:     
    - Spatial RDD based on Huai River heating policy
    - Product fixed effects and city fixed effects
    - Distance to plant IV to capture variation in transportation cost, which is a supply-side cost shifter
- Findings: 
    - Households have a high WTP for air quality, but heterogeneity exists by income and information


## Data
### China Cities 2006-2014

1. Air purifier sales transaction data
    - ratio of HEPA purifier sales relative to non-HEPA purifier sales: 
        - 1.2 for southern consumers compared to 2.0 for northern consumers
2. City-level annual average PM~10~
3. City-year measures on population, urban population, and GDP per capita
4. Location data for cities
    - Distance to Huai River and factory or importing port locations of air purifiers


## Demand for Air Purifiers {.smaller}
### Random Utility Model

- Consumer $i$ in city $c$ can purchase air purifier $j$ at price $p_{jc}$ to reduce indoor air pollution by $x_{jc} = x_c \cdot e_j$
- Purifier $j$’s effectiveness at reducing indoor particulate matter $e_j \in [0,1]$
- Observe markets for $c = 1,...,C$ cities with $i=1,...,I_c$ consumers

Then the conditional indirect utility of consumer $i$ from purchasing air purifier $j$ at city $c$ is

$$
u_{ijc} = \beta_i x_{jc} + \alpha_i \rho_{jc} + \eta_j + \lambda_c + \xi_{jc} + \epsilon_{ijc}
$$

where $x_{jc}$ represents the improvements in indoor air quality conditional
on the purchase of product $j$, $\rho_{jc}$ represents the price of product $j$ in market $c$, $\eta_j$ represents product fixed effects that capture utility gains from unobserved and observed product characteristics, $\lambda_c$ represents city fixed effects, $\xi_{jc}$ represents a product-city specific demand shock, and $\epsilon_{ijc}$ represents a mean-zero stochastic term.

- $\beta_i$: marginal utility for clean air
- $\alpha_i$: marginal disutility of price

## Demand for Air Purifiers {.smaller}
### Logit Model

Assuming that $\beta_i$ = $\beta$ and $\alpha_i$ = $\alpha$ for
consumer $i$ and that the error term is distributed as a type I extreme value
function, then consumer $i$ purchases purifier $j$ if $u_{ijc} > u_{ikc}$ for $\forall k \ne j$. Then the market share for product $j$ in city $c$ is

$$
s_{jc} = \frac{\exp \left( \beta x_{jc} + \alpha p_{jc} + \eta_j + \lambda_c + \xi_{jc} \right)}{\sum_{k=0}^{J} \exp \left( \beta x_{kc} + \alpha p_{kc} + \eta_k + \lambda_c + \xi_{kc} \right)}
$$

which simplifies to 

$$
\begin{align*}
s_{jc} &= \beta x_{jc} + \alpha \rho_{jc} + \eta_j + \lambda_c + \xi_{jc} \\
s_{jc} &= \beta x_{c} H_j + \alpha \rho_{jc} + \eta_j + \lambda_c + \xi_{jc}
\end{align*}
$$

- $x_{c}$: ambient pollution
- $H_j$: indicator variable for HEPA purifiers
- Identifying variation: $x_{c} H_j$ has city-by-product variation and $\rho_{jc}$ has city-by-product

## Empirical Strategy {.smaller}
### RD

First Stage: 

$$
x_c = \gamma N_c + \phi_1 d_c + \phi_2 d_c N_c + \nu_l + \epsilon_c
$$

where $x_c$ represents PM~10~ in city $c$, $N_c$ is the dummy variable for
the north, $d_c$ represents the distance between city $c$ and the Huai River,
and $e_c$ is the error term. 

- $\nu_l$ measures a discontinuous change in $x_c$ at the Huai River border

Reduced form RD: 
$$
\ln s_{jc} = \rho N_c H_j + \alpha p_{jc} + \left( \psi_1 d_c + \psi_2 d_c N_c + \nu_l \right) H_j + \eta_j + \lambda_c + \epsilon_{jc}
$$

where $s_{jc}$ and $p_{jc}$ respectively represent the market share and the price of product $j$ in city $c$, $\eta_j$ represents product fixed effects, and $\lambda_c$ represents city fixed effects.

## Empirical Strategy 
### RD + IV

Estimate the MWTP for clean air (second stage): 

$$
\ln s_{jc} = \rho x_c H_j + \alpha p_{jc} + \left( \psi_1 d_c + \psi_2 d_c N_c + \nu_l \right) H_j + \eta_j + \lambda_c + \epsilon_{jc}
$$

using $N_c H_j$ as the instrument for $x_c H_j$

- $- \beta / \alpha$  represents the MWTP for one unit of PM~10~ (μg/m^3^)
- Also uses transportation costs from a product’s manufacturing location to its market as an IV for price to capture a a supply-side cost shifter that does not directly affect demand
- Exclusion restriction: the instruments must be uncorrelated with the error term given the control variables and fixed effects

![](assets/prez-lecture-6-240912/figure4.png)

## Summary 

- MWTP for removing 1 μ g/m^3^ of PM~10~ per year is $1.34
    - Much higher for higher-income households
- Implied value of a statistical life year (VSLY) per person is $455
    - Greater than Kremer et al. 2011 ($24) but less than León and Miguel 2017 ($13,500 Africans; $23,232 Non-Africans)

- Drawbacks:
    - No information on other indoor avoidance behavior
    - Ignores dynamic decision making
    - Lack of analysis on market failures
