## Motivation

<!-- Open Access: https://www.atai-research.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Aker-Jenny-C-and-B.-Kelsey-Jack.-Harvesting-the-Rain-The-Adoption-of-Environmental-Technologies-in-the-Sahel-December-2023.pdf -->

- Fixed costs of investment may deter adoption of environmental technology
    - Information, liquidity, credit constraints
- Desertification of the Sahel has led to a drop in agricultural production.
- How can we increase adoption of technology for climate adaptation?
    - Low adoption rates of rainwater harvesting technology $\sim$ 10% in Niger

## Research Question 

> Can Rainwater Harvesting (RWH) techniques be a climate adaptation that mitigates climate shocks?

## Overview 

- Context: Niger
    - 180 villages
    - Field experiment to produce water filtration (Kosim filter)
- Methods: 
    - Clustered RCT at village level
    - Treatment recieved training in demi-lune construction
    - Supplemented by a UCT-early of $20 USD and CCT of $0.4 USD per demi-lune constructed and UCT-late of $20.5 USD

## Overview 

- Findings: 
    - Training massively increased adoption with lasting effects over 3 years
    - Intensive of adoption increased with 34 demi-lunes per farmer in treatment over control
    - Information and liquidity for upfront investments are the binding constraints
    - Treatment hired more labor, and increased extensification and agricultural production
    - Profitable tech adoption: revenue ($34) > costs ($30)

## Data
### Demi-Lunes (Technology)

Cost: $80 USD (14% of per capita income)

## Data
### Niger 2018 - 2021

1. Villages
    - 180 villages in Zinder region
    - Elibility:
        - Degraded land
        - No chieftancy disputes & has own chief
2. Households
    - 2,861 households
    - 670 neighoring households for spillover sample

## Empirical Strategy
### Agricultural Calendar

## Empirical Strategy
### Treatment Assignments

- 5 total treatment arms

![](assets/prez-lecture-9-241001/figure-a2.png)

## Empirical Strategy
### Clustered RCT

- $T$: Treatment arm $j$

$$
Y_{iv} = \alpha + \sum_{j = 1}^4 \beta_j T_v^j + \gamma X'_{i0} + \theta_v + \varepsilon_iv
$$


## Results 
### Adoption Rates

## Summary 

- Upfront investment and information constraints are main barriers to climate adaptation adoption
- RWH is a profitiable technology for reversing desertification and increasing agricultural extensification
- Distinct from past literature on one-day trainings (Magruder, 2018; Macours, 2019)
    - Extensive margin adoption: 2,000%
